# Marco Abbadini, PhD Student

I am a PhD Student in Engineering and Applied Sciences at Universit√† degli Studi di Bergamo. My research work focuses on Computer Security and Privacy but I am interested also in many other fields of Computer Science (see my [/about](/about) page for more info).

This is a little presentation website of myself and a place to share ideas, posts or articles that I find interesting.
