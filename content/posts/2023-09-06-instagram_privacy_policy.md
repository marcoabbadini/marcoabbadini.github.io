# On Instagram Privacy Policy in EU

Recently I have decided to use Instagram more frequently than in the past (not used lol), but when I've decided to post some new pics on my profile I was interrogating myself about how that data would be used by Instagram (Meta) and what are the privacy policies that I have agreed when I registered my account.

I had already read all the Privacy Policiy document at the moment of the account registration but since I have never used it for years and privacy policies can change frequently during the years, I took another look to them before giving to Meta all my precious data.
