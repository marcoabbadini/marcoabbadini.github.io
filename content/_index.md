# Marco Abbadini, PhD Student

I am a PhD Student in Engineering and Applied Sciences at Università degli Studi di Bergamo. My research work focuses on Computer Security and Privacy but I am interested also in many other fields of Computer Science (see my [/about](/about) page for more info).

This is a little presentation website of myself and a place to share ideas, posts or articles that I find interesting.

For any info feel free to contact me.

You can see my academic page at Università degli Studi di Bergamo at [/UNIBG](https://cs.unibg.it/abbadini)
